# vehicle-restrictions

Theres no suitable vehicle restrictions API that works for me, which is called "pico y placa" in my country, thats why this repo is built 

Feel free to use the raw service `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iojancode/vehicle-restrictions/master/co-ant-medellin.json` from your app

Feel free to contribute with a PR
