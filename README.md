# Vehicle restrictions API

There's no suitable vehicle restrictions API that works for me, which is called "pico y placa" in my country, that's why this repo is built

Feel free to use the raw service from your app:

| Year | Restriction | Url |
| ---- | ----------- | ----|
| 2024 | Medellín Restrictions | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iojancode/vehicle-restrictions/master/2024/co-ant-medellin.json` |
| 2025 | Medellín Restrictions | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iojancode/vehicle-restrictions/master/2025/co-ant-medellin.json` |

You can create proxies with `openapi.yaml` spec

If your want to contribute please create a PR
