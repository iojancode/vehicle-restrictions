# Vehicle restrictions API / API pico y placa

There's no suitable vehicle restrictions API that works for me, which is called "pico y placa" in my country, that's why this repo is built 

Feel free to use the raw service from your app:

| Restriction | Url |
| -------- | --------|
| Pico y placa Medellín | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iojancode/vehicle-restrictions/master/co-ant-medellin.json` |

You can create proxies with `openapi.yaml` spec

If your want to contribute please create a PR
